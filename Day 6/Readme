Practice & Logic Building

This task focuses on improving problem solving skills using basic Python programs.  
Each program takes input from the user, applies logic, and prints the result.

Programs included:

1. Reverse a Number  
Expected Outcome:  
The program should reverse the digits of the given number.

Actual Outcome:  
The program successfully reversed the number and displayed the correct result.


2. Palindrome Number  
Expected Outcome:  
The program should check whether the number reads the same forward and backward.

Actual Outcome:  
The program correctly identified whether the number is palindrome or not.


3. Count Digits  
Expected Outcome:  
The program should count how many digits are present in the number.

Actual Outcome:  
The program counted the digits accurately.


4. Sum of Digits  
Expected Outcome:  
The program should calculate the total sum of all digits.

Actual Outcome:  
The program calculated and printed the correct sum.


5. Fibonacci Series  
Expected Outcome:  
The program should print Fibonacci numbers up to the given terms.

Actual Outcome:  
The program generated the series correctly.

Outcome of the Task:
Gained better understanding of loops, conditions, and logical thinking in Python.
