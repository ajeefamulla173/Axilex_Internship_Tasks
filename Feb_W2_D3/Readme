Strings and Operations

This task focuses on performing different operations on strings such as reversing, checking palindrome, counting characters, and slicing.

Programs included:

1. Reverse a String
Expected Outcome:
The program should reverse the given string.

Actual Outcome:
The string was reversed successfully and displayed correctly.


2. Palindrome Check
Expected Outcome:
The program should check whether the input string is the same forward and backward.

Actual Outcome:
The program correctly identified whether the string is a palindrome or not.


3. Count Vowels and Consonants
Expected Outcome:
The program should count the number of vowels and consonants present in the string.

Actual Outcome:
The program counted vowels and consonants accurately.


4. Character Frequency
Expected Outcome:
The program should calculate how many times each character appears in the string.

Actual Outcome:
The frequency of each character was calculated and displayed correctly.


5. String Slicing
Expected Outcome:
The program should demonstrate slicing operations like extracting first and last characters and reversing.

Actual Outcome:
The slicing operations worked correctly and the results were displayed.


Outcome of the Task:
Learned how to manipulate strings, apply conditions, loop through characters, and use slicing techniques in Python.
