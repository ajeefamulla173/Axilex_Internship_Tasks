Functions and Code Reusability

This task focuses on creating functions in Python and reusing them to perform different logical operations.

Program 1 Arithmetic Operations using Functions

This program defines separate functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user enters two numbers and the functions are called to perform the operations.

Expected Outcome
The program should perform all arithmetic operations using functions and display the results.

Actual Outcome
The program successfully executed all the defined functions and printed the correct arithmetic results.

Program 2 Factorial of a Number

This program uses a function to calculate the factorial of a given number. The number is taken as input and the function computes the result using a loop.

Expected Outcome
The program should calculate and display the factorial of the entered number.

Actual Outcome
The program correctly computed the factorial value and displayed the output without errors.

Program 3 Prime Number Check

This program defines a function to check whether a number is prime or not. Based on the function result, the appropriate message is displayed.

Expected Outcome
The program should identify whether the entered number is prime.

Actual Outcome
The program evaluated the number correctly and displayed whether it is prime or not.

Final Outcome
By completing this task I learned how to write reusable functions, improve code structure, and apply modular programming in Python.
