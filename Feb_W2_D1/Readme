Python Lists and Tuples

This task focuses on understanding basic operations on lists and converting them into tuples.  
The programs demonstrate creation, searching, sorting, and type conversion.

Programs included:

1. Create and Display a List  
Expected Outcome:  
The program should create a list of numbers and display it.

Actual Outcome:  
The list was created successfully and printed correctly.


2. Largest and Smallest Number in a List  
Expected Outcome:  
The program should find the maximum and minimum values from the list.

Actual Outcome:  
The program displayed the correct largest and smallest numbers.


3. Sort List in Ascending and Descending Order  
Expected Outcome:  
The program should sort the list from smallest to largest and vice versa.

Actual Outcome:  
The program sorted the list correctly in both ascending and descending order.


4. Convert List to Tuple  
Expected Outcome:  
The program should convert the given list into a tuple.

Actual Outcome:  
The list was successfully converted and printed as a tuple.


Outcome of the Task:
Understood how to store multiple values using lists, apply operations like sorting and searching, and learned the difference between lists and tuples.
