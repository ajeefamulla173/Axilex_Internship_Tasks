Loops

This task focuses on understanding repetition and iteration in Python using for and while loops.

Program 1 For Loop and While Loop Demonstration

This program shows how for and while loops can be used to repeat statements multiple times based on a condition.

Expected Outcome
The program should print numbers repeatedly using both for and while loops.

Actual Outcome
The program executed successfully and displayed the sequence of numbers using both looping methods.

Program 2 Multiplication Table

This program takes a number from the user and prints its multiplication table using a loop.

Expected Outcome
The program should generate and display the multiplication table of the entered number.

Actual Outcome
The program correctly printed the multiplication table from 1 to 10.

Program 3 Star Pattern

This program uses loops to print a simple increasing star pattern based on the number of rows given by the user.

Expected Outcome
The program should display the star pattern in proper format.

Actual Outcome
The program successfully printed the star pattern as expected.

Final Outcome
By completing this task I gained understanding of loops, iteration, and how repetitive tasks can be automated in Python.
