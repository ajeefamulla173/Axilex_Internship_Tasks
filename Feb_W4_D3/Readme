 Python Database Connectivity (CRUD Operations)

# Objective

The objective of this task is to establish database connectivity using Python and perform basic database operations such as Insert, Select, Update, and Delete (CRUD operations).

# Technologies Used

* Python 3
* SQLite Database
* sqlite3 Module
* Visual Studio Code

# Database Used

SQLite database (database.db) is used for storing and managing student records.

# Steps Performed

# Database Connection

Python was connected to the SQLite database using the built-in sqlite3 module.

# Table Creation

A Students table was created with the following fields:

* ID (Primary Key)
* Name
* Age
* Course

# CRUD Operations Implemented

# Create (Insert)

Inserted student data into the Students table.

# Read (Select)

Fetched and displayed all student records from the database.

# Update

Updated the age of a specific student record.

# Delete

Deleted a student record from the database.

# Files Included

* crud_operations.py – Python script performing database operations
* database.db – SQLite database file
* Screenshot of program execution

# Output

The program successfully demonstrates database connection, record insertion, record retrieval, record update, and record deletion.

# Conclusion

Python was successfully connected to the SQLite database, and all CRUD operations were implemented using SQL queries through the sqlite3 module.
