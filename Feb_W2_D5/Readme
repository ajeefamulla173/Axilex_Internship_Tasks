 Exception Handling in Python

1. Try-Except Program
Expected Outcome:
The program should accept user input and handle invalid entries using exception handling.

Actual Outcome:
The program successfully handled wrong input and displayed an error message instead of stopping.


2. Handle Division by Zero
Expected Outcome:
The program should prevent division when the denominator is zero and show an appropriate message.

Actual Outcome:
The division by zero condition was handled correctly and the program displayed an error message.


3. Handle File Errors
Expected Outcome:
The program should handle situations where the file does not exist.

Actual Outcome:
When the file was missing, the program caught the error and informed the user properly.


4. Custom Exception Example
Expected Outcome:
The program should raise and handle a user-defined exception for invalid data.

Actual Outcome:
The custom exception worked correctly and displayed the warning message when the condition failed.


Outcome of the Task:
Learned how to manage errors using try and except, prevent program crashes, and create custom exceptions for better control over program execution.
